# Django HTMX Chatroom Example

This example shows using polling to create a chat room

## Running the example

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python manage.py migrate`
* `python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json`
* `python manage.py runserver`
* Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

Users (all passwords are `unicorn`):
* `admin`
* `luna`
* `astra`

You must log in as one of these users to see the chat room.

If you'd like to test with multiple users, use several incognito windows or different browsers.
